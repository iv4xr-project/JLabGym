/**
 * This represents the raw navigation-mesh sent by Lab-Recruits. It is a list of
 * indices and and vertices, such that if indices[i] = k and vertices[k] is a
 * Vec3 p, then this means that the point p is a corner belonging to the face 
 * with the id/index k in the mesh.
 * 
 * The faces in the mesh are always triangles. And the indices are always
 * stored consecutively. So, for example indices[0], indices[1], indices[2]
 * belong to the first triangle, and then indices[3], indices[4], indices[5]
 * belong to the next triangle.
 * 
 * The triangles are numbered increasingly. So, indices[0]=indices[1]=indices[2] 
 * should be 0. The next triplets should point to index 1, and so on.
